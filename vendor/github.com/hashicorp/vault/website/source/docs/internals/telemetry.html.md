# Telemetry

The Vault server process collects various runtime metrics about the performance of different libraries and subsystems. These metrics are aggregated on a ten second interval and are retained for one minute.

To view the raw data, you must send a signal to the Vault process: on Unix-style operating systems, this is `USR1` while on Windows it is `BREAK`. When the Vault process receives this signal it will dump the current telemetry information to the process's `stderr`.

This telemetry information can be used for debugging or otherwise getting a better view of what Vault is doing.

Telemetry information can also be streamed directly from Vault to a range of metrics aggregation solutions as described in the [telemetry Stanza documentation][telemetry-stanza].

The following is an example telemetry dump snippet:

You'll note that log entries are prefixed with the metric type as follows:

- **[C]** is a counter
- **[G]** is a gauge
- **[S]** is a summary


The following sections describe available Vault metrics. The metrics interval can be assumed to be 10 seconds when manually triggering metrics output using the above described signals.

## Internal Metrics

These metrics represent operational aspects of the running Vault instance.

### vault.audit.log_request

**NOTE**: This is a particularly important metric. Any non-zero value here indicates that there was a failure to make an audit log request to any of the configured audit log backends; **when Vault cannot log to any of the configured audit log backends it ceases all user operations**, and you should begin troubleshooting the audit log backends immediately if this metric continually increases.

### vault.audit.log_response_failure

**[C]** Counter (Number of failures): Number of audit log response failures

**NOTE**: This is a particularly important metric. Any non-zero value here indicates that there was a failure to receive a response to a request made to one of the configured audit log backends; **when Vault cannot log to any of the configured audit log backends it ceases all user operations**, and you should begin troubleshooting the audit log backends immediately if this metric continually increases.
