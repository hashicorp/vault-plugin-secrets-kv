# Vault Operations

Vault Operations guides address Vault infrastructure discussions.  These
guides are designed to help the operations team to plan and install a Vault
cluster that meets your organization's needs.

- [Production Hardening](/guides/operations/production.html) guide provides
guidance on best practices for a production hardened deployment of Vault.
The recommendations are based on the [security model](/docs/internals/security.html)
and focus on defense in depth.
- [Replication Setup & Guidance](/guides/operations/replication.html)
walks you through the commands to activate the Vault servers in replication mode.
Please note that [Vault Replication](/docs/vault-enterprise/replication/index.html)
is a Vault Enterprise feature.
